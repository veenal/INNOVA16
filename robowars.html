				<h4><b>Problem Statement/Task:</b></h4>
					<p><span>

Optimus prime has send Bumblebee on a mission to infiltrate the base of Decepticons using 

a device made by Rachet which would make him invisible. He cannot be detected easily. 

Some error comes to the device, Bumblebee gets attacked by the group of Deceptions 

which would tear him apart. Optimus prime cannot save Bumblebee, so he request you to 

make a robot that can tear these Decepticons apart and save Bumblebee.
<BR>
Task: <BR>

Your task is to create a robot that can tear these evil Decepticons in order to protect 

Bumblebee. Your bot will be given a title Autobot to protect earth from Megatron and his 

evil Decepticons.</span></p>

					<h4><b>Event rules:</b></h4>
					<p><span>

Rounds:<BR>

Round1: Elimination Round
<BR>
Round2: Death Match
<BR>
Round3: Battle Royal
<BR>
Details Will Be Revealed On The Day of The Event
<BR>
War Rules:
<BR>
1. A member of the team will operate the robot.
<BR>
2. Power Supply would be provided in the arena. Team should get it checked before 

starting the game.
<BR>
3. Damaging of enemy team control wire is prohibited.
<BR>
4. Use of unfair means will lead to disqualification of the team.
<BR><BR>
Team Specifications:
<BR>
1. Any Team can participate in Robo Wars. The team is allowed to make 5 members at 

most.
<BR>
2. Every team must have a name which must be unique and attractive. Organizers must 

be notified during if a Team's name has been changed.
<BR>
3. Each team must specify their Team Representative (Leader) at the time of 

registration on the website. All important communications between organisers and 

the registered teams will be done through Team Representative. The Team 

Representatives must submit valid contact details (phone no., email ID etc.) at the 

time of registration.<BR>
<BR>
Arena Specifications: 
<BR>
The arena will be rectangular in shape measuring 12ft x 12ft.Pushing the opponent bot 

out of this fight zone will result in victory. The arena might be on hard and uneven 

ground and will be enclosed by a 5ft high wire meshes all around.
<BR><BR><BR>
Robot Specifications:<BR>

1. The robot must fit inside a box of dimensions 70cm x 70cm x 55cm during the whole 

Battle. The external device used to control the machine or any external tank is not 

included in the size constraint. 
<BR>
2. The machine should not exceed 45 kg of weight including the weight of pneumatic 

source/tank. All pneumatic tanks/source and batteries should be onboard. Weight of 

adaptors and the remote controller will not be counted, violating which would lead 

to disqualification. 
<BR>
3. The robot can be wired or wireless, it depends on the user on which mechanism they 

are comfortable with.
<BR>
4. The robot should not harm the track in any manner. Harming the arena in any way 

lead to disqualification.
<BR>
5. In case of wired mechanism, the participants must ensure that the wire does not get 

entangled with the opponent’s robot during the game. The maximum length of wire 

from remote control to robot should be of 6m.
<BR>
6. The Robot cannot be constructed using readymade Lego kits or any readymade 

mechanism. Violating this would lead to the disqualification of the team.
<BR>
7. The Robot should not detach by itself during the game.
<BR>
8. The power supply provided by the organizers will be 1 phase 230V AC.
<BR>
9. The Robot can use external placed or on-board supply.
<BR>
10. Any extension cords, adaptors etc. required will have to be arranged by participants 

themselves.
<BR>
Mobility:
<BR>
All robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of 

mobility include:
<BR>
1. Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).
<BR>
2. Non-wheeled robots having no rolling elements in contact with the floor and no 

continuous rolling or cam operated motion in contact with the floor, either directly 

or via a linkage. Motion is "continuous" if continuous operation of the drive motor(s) 

produces continuous motion of the robot. Linear-actuated legs and novel non-

wheeled drive systems come under this category.
<BR>
3. Jumping and hopping is not allowed.
<BR>
4. Flying (using airfoil, helium balloons, ornithopters, etc.) is not allowed.
<BR><BR>
Weapons:<BR>

Robots can use any kind of blades, cutters, magnetic weapons, spinning hammer ,lifting 

devices, saws, etc. as weapons with following limitations:
<BR>
1. Flame-based weapons.
<BR>
2. Any kind of inflammable liquid.
<BR>
3. Any kind of explosive or intentionally ignited solid or potentially ignitable solid.
<BR>
4. Nets, tape, glue, or any other entanglement device.
<BR>
5. High power magnets or electromagnets.
<BR>
6. Radio jamming, tazers, tesla coils, or any other high-voltage device. 
<BR>
7. Tethered or un-tethered projectiles.
<BR>
8. Any kind of inflammable liquid.
<BR>
Note: If a Robot is deemed dangerous by the judges it would be disqualified 

automatically. 
<BR><BR>
Pneumatics: 
<BR>
a) Robot can use pressurized non-inflammable gases to actuate pneumatic devices. 
<BR>
Maximum allowed outlet nozzle pressure is 12 bar. 
<BR>
b) The storage tank and pressure regulators used by teams need to be certified and 

teams using pneumatics are required to produce the Safety and Security letters at 

the Registration Desk at the venue. Failing to do so will lead to direct disqualification.   
<BR>
c) The maximum pressure should not exceed rated pressure.
<BR>
d) All pneumatics component should be properly mounted on the Robot. No 

component of the robot should detach during the game.
<BR>
e) All pneumatics components should be on-board, no external input should be applied 

from outside the arena.
<BR>
There can be some hazards in the arena (subject to change).
<BR><BR>
Criterion of Victory:
<BR>
1. A robot is declared victorious if the opponent is/are immobilized.
<BR>
2. A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one 

inch in a timed period of 30 seconds. A bot with one side of its drive train disabled 

will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. 

This rule will also apply to any robot that becomes trapped by any part of the arena 

or arena hazards, including the pit.
<BR>
3. A robot if fallen in the pit of death will lose the match automatically.
<BR>
4. If a robot is thrown out of the arena the match will stop immediately, and the robot 
<BR>
still inside the arena will automatically be declared as the winner.
<BR>
5. If a robot is unable to move during the start of the game no extra time would be 

given to the team and will be disqualified.
<BR>
6. Robots cannot win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning 

or lifting for a maximum of 20 seconds per pin/lift then the robots will be instructed 

the attacker to release. If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker is able to 

release but does not, their robot may be disqualified.
<BR>
7. If a Robot is destroyed by the attacker robot than the attacker would be declared a 

winner.
<BR>
8. In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner 

will be decided subjectively. The decision of the judges will be taken as final verdict 

and will not be contested. 
<BR>
9. Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage, control and strategy and will 

be used in case multiple robots are mobile after the round ends. 
<BR>
A) Aggression – Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness and 
<BR>
B) Control – Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest 
<BR>
C) Damage – Through deliberate action, a robot either directly, or indirectly using 
<BR>
D) Strategy – The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's strengths 

effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If 

a robot appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be 

considered Aggression. 

point, use its weapons in the most effective way, avoid Arena Hazards, and 

minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its weapons. 

the Arena Hazards, reduces the functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an 

opponent. Damage is not considered relevant if a robot inadvertently harms 

itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning device on as robot 

fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered "deliberate". 

against the weaknesses of its opponent. Strategy is also defined as a robot 

exhibiting a deliberate defence plan that guards its weaknesses against the 

strengths of the opponent. Strategy can also involve using the Arena Hazards to 

gain an advantage.  
<BR><BR>
Safety Rules:
<BR>
Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the 

rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing 
<BR>
1. Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries and pneumatics, 

robot without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.
<BR>
2. Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is 

allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating 

principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.
<BR>
3. Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated 

in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent of the event coordinators. 
<BR>
4. All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.
<BR>
5. All the resources provided at the time of competition from the organizers should be 

strictly used only after the consent of the organizers.
<BR>
6. Once the robots have entered into the arena, no team members can enter into the 

arena at any point of time. In case if fight has to be halted in between and some 

changes have to be done in the arena or condition of the robot(s), it will be done by 

organizers only
