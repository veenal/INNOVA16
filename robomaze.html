				<h4><b>Problem Statement/Task:</b></h4>
					<p><span>

It’s the final of TRIWIZARD tournament. As Harry Potter is about to 

enter the maze, Prof. Snape smells trap for Harry. As he cannot stop 

the tournament or enter himself in the maze so he decides to send a 

bot following the trail of Harry. Well we all know how good Snape is in 

potion n dark arts but he needs help to make a bot …….. 
<BR>
TASK:  
<BR>
1. Participants have to make an autonomous bot which is capable of 
<BR>
moving over a maze like structure following a line. 
<BR>
2. Bot must be capable of avoiding any obstacle of reasonable size.</span></p>
<BR>
					<h4><b>Event rules:</b></h4>
					<p><span>

ROUNDS:
<BR>
There will be 3 rounds including the prelims. 
<BR>
ARENA: 
<BR>
Round 1(prelims): 
<BR>
An arena of 1524mm x 1524mm would consist of white path of 

thickness 25mm on black base (look for sample image Fig.1). 
<BR>
 

                                                                                                 

The line following capability of the bot will be checked in this round. 
<BR>
Round 2: 
<BR>
An arena of 1524mm x 1524mm would consist of white path of 

thickness 25mm on black base the path would consist of several 

obstacles* and checkpoints. 
<BR>
Round 3: 
<BR>
An arena of 2133mm x 2133mm would consist of complex maze of white 

path of thickness 25mm on black base the path would consist of several 

obstacles* and checkpoints. 

The bot must reach the center of the maze and return to start in 

minimum time. 
<BR>
Bot Specification:  
<BR>
• The autonomous bot must fit into the box of dimension 220 mm X 

220 mm X 220 mm (lxbxh).  
<BR>
• Bot must be started individually by only one switch.   However a 

team may have onboard switch for restart. This switch has to be 

shown to the organizer before the run.  
<BR>
• Bot must have a red LED which will glow once it reaches the end 

zone of the arena. 
<BR>
• During the run, the autonomous bot must not damage the arena in 

any way. It is not allowed to leave anything behind or make any 

marks while traversing the arena. Any bot found damaging the 

 

                                                                                                 

arena will be immediately disqualified. The final decision is at the 

discretion of the organizers.  
<BR>
• Bot must have on board power supply.  
<BR>
• When using the electric power supply, the potential difference 

between any 2 points must not exceed 24 V at any point of time 

during the game.  
<BR>
• The autonomous bot should not separate or split into two or more 

units. All bots/units which are touching each other or are in the 

starting point will be considered as one bot. 
<BR>
• Machine cannot be constructed using readymade ‘Lego kits’ or any 

readymade mechanism. But they can make use of readymade gear 

assemblies. Violating this clause will lead to disqualification of the 

team. 
<BR>
                                                                                                 


Blockage 
<BR>
A block (approx. 20 x 6.5 x 12 cm) (lxbxh) will be placed on the course. 
<BR>
The robot has to drive around this brick to reach the continuation of 

the line. 
<BR>
Seesaw 
<BR>
A seesaw (see Fig.3) is placed somewhere on the course. The length of 

the seesaw is at least 50 cm. The axis of the seesaw is mounted at 

most 12 cm above the ground. The black line continues on the seesaw. 
<BR>

</span></p>

<h4><b>General Rules :</b></h4>
<p><span>



<BR>
• The teams will have to submit their bot before the start of the 

competition. Only those teams which submit their bots will be 

allowed to participate. The bot will be handed back to the team.  
<BR>
• During the time of their run. They will be given 1 minute for 

calibration. If any team is found to alter its code after depositing 

its bots, then it will be immediately disqualified from the 

competition. They are however allowed to make any other 

hardware changes.  
<BR>
• Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed. 
<BR>
• When the autonomous bot starts, no team member is allowed to 

touch the bot or enter the arena.  
<BR>
• At the start of the task, the bot will be placed at the starting 

point. Only 1 team member is allowed to be near the game field 

while starting the bot.  
<BR>
• Run will start only when organizers give the signal. 
<BR>
• The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and should 

not involve giving bot any manual force or impulse in any direction.  
<BR>
• A total of 5 minutes will be given. The bot have to finish the dry 

run and main run in that period only.  

 <BR>

                                                                                                 

General Rules  
<BR>
1. All the students enrolled in high school, undergraduate, 

postgraduate (excluding PhD.) program at any recognized institute 

(identity card will be checked) are eligible to participate.  
<BR>
2. Team must declare a name for their machine at the time of 

competition.  
<BR>
3. A team may consist of max 4 members. The members from 

different colleges can form a team.  
<BR>
4. If the robot goes off the track in its first attempt, it will be 

given 2 more chances. The teams can make some hardware changes 

during this period, like changing batteries, adjusting sensors, but no 

extra hardware can be added and no changes in the code can be made.  
<BR>
5. The teams may take their robots off the track twice while 

running for calibration and adjustments which would result in time 

penalties.  
<BR>
6. In case of a tie, a tie breaker will be held or team crossing the 

obstacle* path will be declared winner.  
<BR>
7. Rules are liable to minor changes which will be 

updated on the site.  
<BR>
8. In case any kind of dispute arises the judges’ decision will be 

considered final and binding to all and no argument will be entertained. 

Judges have the right to disqualify any team if they feel the team is 

not playing with fair interest.  
<BR>
 <BR>

Judgment Criteria  
<BR>
 

                                                                                                 

1. The extent to which all the specifications of the entire robot have 

been implemented.  
<BR>
2. No. of successful checkpoints/obstacles cleared by the bot.  
<BR>
3. Extent to which it performed in arena (less diversion from the path).  
<BR>
4. Finesse in algorithm and hardware fabrication.  

 <BR>

Organiser’s Decision  
<BR>
1. The organisers reserve the right to make changes to any of the 

above in the interest of fair play and sportsmanship, and to ensure 

that all competitors have an enjoyable competition.
